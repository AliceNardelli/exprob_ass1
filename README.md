rndm room generator
look around server
move action


The apartment is arranged as a matrix according to the figure so each room is associated to a point (x,y), movement is on a straigth line at costant velocity. This choise to simulate a little bit movent instead of only wait

perception with srv:
    look around action which call subscribes one hint to a publisher which read hints from rosparam, difficult to manage no percetion case. Good idea since typically we subscribes to an hint
    divide the look around action behaviour and perception srv. No much sense.
The possibility of not perceive an hint is always 1/4. Logically it is possible also to randomize this aspect
